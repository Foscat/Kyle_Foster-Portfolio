# Portfolio

New fancy Portfolio built from the ground up. Using bootstap for grid system and picmonkey for custom image work makes for a slick unique profile. With links to reach me in networking and peersonal contact info. It also includes a resume html so that viewers can see a more detailed picture of my work experiance.

update-- I am going to use this frame for the update rather than building a new one but just re arragnging things and giving it a designer color scheme and a few other design tweaks.
