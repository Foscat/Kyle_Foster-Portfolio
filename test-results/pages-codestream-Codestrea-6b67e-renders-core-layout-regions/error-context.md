                - paragraph [ref=e67]: During my tenure at CodeStream Studios LLC, I served as the sole front-end developer responsible for taking our React.js application from concept to production. I owned the front-end architecture, translated rough ideas into concrete features, and shipped a platform that became the backbone of our classroom operations.
                - paragraph [ref=e68]: "Working with a lean team meant I routinely stepped outside a typical developer lane: I handled implementation, bug fixing, UI polish, documentation, and coordination with instructors using the platform in real classrooms. That blend of hands-on coding and tight feedback loops allowed me to build features that were practical, resilient, and directly informed by real-world usage."

That dual perspective—as both developer and instructor—let me quickly identify friction points and improve the experience without waiting on lengthy feedback cycles.
                - paragraph [ref=e78]: What started as a single-school tool evolved into a multi-organization teaching platform with virtual classrooms, curriculum management, licensing, grading, and admin controls—all layered on top of the core 3-panel code editor.

                - paragraph [ref=e361]: I designed and built a three-panel interface that acts like a small IDE inside the browser. The left panel renders Markdown-based lesson instructions via ReactMarkdown. The center panel uses AceEditor to provide a real coding experience with language-aware editing for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. The right panel shows the live result—either a sandboxed iframe for Web projects or an in-browser terminal for Python.
                - paragraph [ref=e362]: For Web lessons, the editor combines separate HTML/CSS/JS files into a single sandboxed bundle that runs safely inside an iframe. For Python, I integrated Skulpt via CDN to compile and execute code in the browser, streaming output into a dedicated console view.
                - paragraph [ref=e363]: I wired custom keyboard shortcuts into AceEditor to support behaviors like save-on-Ctrl+S. Project files are persisted to AWS S3 instead of local storage, allowing students and teachers to open and review work from any device. Teachers see exactly what students see, which became critical for grading and real-time assistance.

Each organization needed to manage teachers, student rosters, active classrooms, and course access, all under a single license."
                - paragraph [ref=e404]: We had to enforce limits on how many students and teachers could be active, gate access to premium curriculum, and gracefully handle expired licenses. At the same time, students needed to keep access to their personal projects, even when a school's license expired. The challenge was building a flexible permission system that felt simple to users but could express all of these rules reliably.

It was slow, awkward, and made it difficult to give deep feedback without sacrificing everyone else's time."

From a secure grading view, teachers and organization admins can open a student's project, run their code, and leave structured feedback without interrupting the rest of the class.
                - paragraph [ref=e832]: To support different school expectations, I implemented a flexible grading model that supports both Pass/Fail and Numeric/Letter grading modes. A UI toggle switches modes, while the database stores everything in a single integer-based model (e.g., -2 = ungraded, -1 = fail, 101 = pass, 0–100 = numeric/letter). Students see their assignment grades and class average directly on the Classroom page.

              - paragraph [ref=e1417]: My time at CodeStream Studios LLC was defined by building real products for real classrooms. As the sole front-end developer—and often the person connecting engineering, instruction, and operations—I had to design systems that worked not just in theory, but in the hands of teachers and students who depended on them every week.
              - paragraph [ref=e1418]: "Although the company ultimately closed due to financial and organizational challenges, the experience gave me deep, practical exposure to product design, system architecture, and long-term platform stewardship. I'm bringing those lessons forward into my next role: designing tools that are robust, understandable, and genuinely useful to the people who rely on them."
